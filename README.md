# About project
Bagiel is a simple framework used for creating simple 2D games in C++, very similar to SFML.
Currently it can:
- create window;
- handle mouse and keyboard inputs;
- draw simple color rectangles using batch rendering.
Unfortunately, documentation is not available right now, so the best method to check capabilities is just reading source code. Sorry :(

# Building
Project is written using CMake, so only dependencies used are CMake itself and Git. After building it is necessary to copy *res* directory to build location.
